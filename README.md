Pacman
======

![in-game screenshot](https://libregamewiki.org/images/1/18/Pacman.png "in-game screenshot")

This is a clone of the original pacman by Namco, as I remember, that I played for the first time on an Atari 130 XL in the early 90s.
Also, Paul Neave's pacman clone has inspired me greatly.
One of the main goals of this implementation is an SDL application with a very low CPU usage.


## Install hint ##
You'll need
* libsdl
* sdl-image
* sdl-ttf
* and sdl-mixer.

Then, download the zip file or clone the repository. Inside the pacman directory, run
1. `./configure`
2. `make`
3. `make install`

You should now be able to start the game via command line: `pacman`
